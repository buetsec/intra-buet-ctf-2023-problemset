Solution:
1. Basically, a problem using RSA.
2. the second RSA problem has incomplete info, which you will extract by cracking the 1st one.
3. For the 1st problem: n, e, c is given.
4. [cracking] Decompose the n, then you can get phi_n. Use that to find out d, and decrypt the cyphertext c.
5. the decrypted plaintext is the n of the second RSA problem.
6. For the second RSA problem, previously only e, c was given. Now you also have n. So, the problem contains complete information to crack the second RSA.
7. [cracking] similar to 1st one.
8. You get a string of numbers. You notice that none of the digits in that number exceed 8. So, it must be an octal string.
9. convert the octal to ascii, and you get the string: RSA_CRAZE

Flag: buet{RSA_CRAZE}
