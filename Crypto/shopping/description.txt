Description: Your mom gave you a list and some TaKa, and sent you shopping. After reaching the shop, you find out that the list reads 'k3dnbg_da3_oqdk4_w0gor', but you're pretty sure she mentioned buying vinegar to make some aachar last night. 

Do you love your mom enough to understand what she wanted to say?
