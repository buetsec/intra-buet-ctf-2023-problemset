### Challenge Description

---

Picachu takes lots of random pics. He sends you all the photos in his gallery, which are repititive images, to say the least. You doubt that there might be a message hidden in plain sight. Can you find it, UwU?

### Solution of {Pikachu}

---

#### Skills need to solve this problem

1. Cryptography
2. Base64 detection, Base64 to ascii.
3. Python image analysis/file analysis

#### Process

---

1. Inspect the images carefully. They could be differentiated by color or size difference. There are in total two classes of images here. Map each class to a 0 or 1. Traverse the whole directory, and map each image sequencially and concatenate. Finally, you'll get a binary string. 
2. Then convert the binary to ascii, which will be a base64 string.
3. Again, convert the base64 to ascii.
4. Text returned: b1n4ry_1s_fun
