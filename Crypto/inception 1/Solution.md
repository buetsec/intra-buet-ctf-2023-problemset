### Challenge Description

---

As overth1nker sat in his lair, scheming and plotting, he knew there was only one thing on his mind - the extra chicken leg in the BBQ party. And so, he set his devious plan in motion. He would invite pagle to the departmental BBQ party, but little did pagle know, overth1nker had no intention of actually wanting him to attend. All overth1nker wants is to increase the headcount and get the extra chicken leg.

With a sly grin on his face, overth1nker crafted the invitation, carefully encrypting the invitation message so that it would be impossible for pagle to understand. And with a click of the button, the invite was sent, and the waiting game began.

Pagle, confused by the encrypted message, reached out to you for help. You could see the distress in his eyes, and knew that you had to act fast.

Can you help pagle one up overth1nker?

Put the flag in `buet{flag}` format.

Hint 1: You ask pagle about overth1nker, and he said that overth1nker likes multiples of 8, and likes the movie inception.
Hint 2: Give the chef my regards
