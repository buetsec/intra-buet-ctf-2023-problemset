Description :-

Imagine, on a weekday, you were going to sit on a EEE CT chanting the famous slogan "EEE ***", nvm.
Suddenly you heard a birdcall which lifted up your mood and your CT came out to be
too good(yeah dude..it only happens in imagination.. pera nai chill). 
You have much fascination with LATIN words. Can you find the LATIN name of that bird's species?
